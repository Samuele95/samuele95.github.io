## Research Interests

My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence, security, and systems programming:

- **Context Engineering & Agentic AI** - Advanced architectures for managing context in large language models, multi-agent orchestration, and autonomous AI systems.
- **Malware Analysis** - Automated analysis techniques, memory forensics, and AI-assisted reverse engineering.
- **Language Implementation** - Compiler design, virtual machine architectures, and domain-specific languages.
- **Multi-Agent Systems** - Coordination protocols, emergent behavior, and distributed AI systems.

## Current Work

### Context Engineering for LLM Applications

Investigating novel approaches to context management in production LLM systems, including:
- Dynamic context window optimization
- Semantic chunking strategies for RAG
- Multi-agent context sharing protocols

### AI-Assisted Malware Analysis

Developing automated pipelines that combine traditional analysis tools with AI capabilities:
- Automated YARA rule generation
- Pattern recognition in malware families
- Natural language reporting from analysis results
